# gadmr: An R Interface to the GADM Map Repository

[GADM](https://gadm.org) wants to map the administrative areas of all
countries, at all levels of sub-division. GADM provides maps and spatial
data for all countries and their sub-divisions for download from its
website. This package facilitates access to these maps and spatial data
for download in R.

[GitHub](https://github.com/SpatialWorks/gadmr.git) with:
